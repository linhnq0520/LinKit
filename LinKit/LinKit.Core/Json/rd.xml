            This directive instructs the runtime to root the entire 'Microsoft.AspNetCore'
            assembly and all of its types with all their members.
            This is a powerful but broad workaround for libraries that use heavy reflection
            at runtime, which the AOT static analysis cannot predict.
            It ensures that when Assembly.Load("Microsoft.AspNetCore") is called,
            the assembly and its metadata are available.
